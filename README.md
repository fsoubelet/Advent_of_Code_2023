# Advent_of_Code_2023

This repository contains the code for my [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023/) solutions.
I've decided to take this opportunity to try out [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/).


## Running

Solution programs as well as exercises prompts and inputs are included in the repository.

Any program can be run by moving into the relevant directory and calling it directly.
For instance, running the `Python` solution for the day 1 challenge would go as:
```bash
cd python/day_01
python solution.py
```

Similarly, for `Nim`, which involves compilation:
```bash
cd nim/day_01
nim c solution.nim
./solution
```

## Requirements

You need a working `Python` and `Nim` installation.
I will try to update the requirements for both languages as I go.
For now, the needed external packages are:

| **Python** | **Nim** |
| :--------: | :-----: |
|            |         |
